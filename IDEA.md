# Document Scanner

For digitizing documents, traditionally, we had to use expensive hardwares like Scanners. With the advent of machine learning we can now just use our phone camera to scan and digitize all kinds of paper documents. Mobile document scanners are a must-have for students and businesses for removing busy background and generating high resolution perfectly aligned images.

Several document scanners were readily available in the market until recently when the Indian government banned most of these apps due to privacy concerns since personal data being scanned by these apps were going to private firms. Hence an open-source mobile document scanner becomes a need of the hour.
